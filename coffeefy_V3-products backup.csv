This makes efficient use of the filter. Standing pre-filtered water is never left in the water tank&#44; where it could quickly become unhygienic. In addition to calcium&#44; which causes lime scale build up&#44; it filters out heavy metals and substances that impair smell and taste&#44; such as chlorine. Minerals that are important for health are retained in the water. The result: pure water for perfect specialty coffees and optimum protection against lime scale inside the coffee machine.<br />The intelligent water filter<br />Coffee is 98% water. So water of the highest quality is essential to creating the best possible coffee experience. The CLEARYL Smart water filter from JURA revolutionizes water filtration. For the first time&#44; thanks to modern RFID (Radio-frequency Identification) technology&#44; a coffee machine can continually communicate with the filter. It recognizes whether a Jura water filter has been inserted and automatically activates the appropriate mode. It continually collects information about filter use and alerts the user when the filter capacity has been exhausted. This not only makes changing the Jura water filter easier than ever before&#44; but also allows the CLEARYL Smart to achieve optimum effectiveness.<br />Automatic filter detection<br />To enable the filter and coffee machine to communicate&#44; JURA uses modern RFID technology. Any machine fitted with the intelligent water system (I.W.S.) recognizes when a filter is inserted&#44; automatically switches to filter mode and starts the rinsing process. When the filter capacity is nearly used up the machine prompts the user to change the Jura water filter. If the filter is not changed&#44; the machine activates descaling mode. After a certain amount of use&#44; the user is prompted to descale the machine.<br />,wh2-boston,1000,

First recognizing them and then eliminating them. We all deal with grind and dose&#44; temperature and brew pressure&#44; roast level and freshness&#44; and so much more. Tamping force is often overlooked and becomes the last variable. Sure&#44; you can get the scale from the bath and test your strength&#44; but that is not a permanent nor sanitary solution. The Espro Calibrated Tamper is a precision tool that will give you a 30 pound tamping force every time. If you used a tamper before&#44; you already know how to use the Espro Calibrated Tamper.<br />HOW TO USE• Pick up the Espro Calibrated tamper and hold it comfortably in your hand• Place the Espro Calibrated Tamper in the portafilter on top of the coffee• Press down until you feel the internal mechanism “release” signaling that you have reached 30 pounds.• Lift tamper out of the portafilter.<br />That's right. It feels and works just like a “regular” tamper&#44; but gives a tactile feedback the moment you reach thirty pounds of tamping force. The heavy stainless steel base and the shape of the gloss black finished handle give the tamer a heft and makes it easy to keep stable when tamping.The Espro Calibrated Tamper has a one year warranty and will last years even under the heaviest of commercial use. What if something happens after that? If it is dropped? A part breaks? The tamper can be rebuilt buy the folks who built it. Espro is located in Canada and their service and support staff are there to help.We carry the 58mm & 53mm flat base models. If you have been using the plastic tamper that came with your machine or some lightweight aluminum tamper&#44; isn't it time you moved up to a professional quality tool?<br />,wh2-boston,1000,

Caffeine&#44; which acts on the prefrontal cortex&#44; increases alertness and improves short-term memory. Each person has their own threshold for caffeine—the point where it ceases to be pleasant and gives us the jitters. People who enjoy coffee in the morning may eschew it in the evening. And there are others who enjoy a cup of coffee&#44; hold the caffeine please.<br />""In creating our decaffeinated illy coffee&#44; we wanted to keep the complex aromas that illy is known for&#44;"" says Dr. Ernesto Illy. ""After careful research&#44; we selected our decaffeinating process based on its superior conservation of aromas and full&#44; pleasant taste in the decaf. In blind tastings&#44; many professional tasters picked illy decaf as their first choice for aroma and taste—even beating our regular (caffeinated) coffee. That is because inherently caffeine has a slight bitterness to it&#44; so when you decaffeinate coffee properly&#44; it tastes slightly sweeter. If you can also capture the same complex aromas—you have a truly wonderful cup of coffee—if you don't miss the caffeine.""<br />A Short History of Decaffeination<br />Dr. Ludwig Roselius and Dr. Karl Wimmer invented the process of removing caffeine from coffee in Bremen&#44; Germany as described in a patent letter dated from 1905. By 1912 the first decaffeinating plant was opened in the United States.<br />In order for a coffee to be designated as ""decaffeinated"" the caffeine content must be lower than 0.10% according to the European Standard<br />There are several methods of making decaffeinated espresso and coffee: Methylene Chloride&#44; Ethyl Acetate&#44; and Water Process<br />illycaffè's method of choice - Carbon Dioxide<br />This process is technically known as supercritical fluid extraction. In the carbon dioxide method&#44; the caffeine is stripped directly from the beans by a highly compressed semi-liquid form of carbon dioxide. Pre-steamed beans are soaked in a bath of supercritical carbon dioxide at a pressure of 73 to 300 atmospheres. After a thorough soaking for around ten hours&#44; the pressure is reduced&#44; allowing the CO2 to evaporate&#44; or the pressurized CO2 is run through either water or charcoal filters to remove the caffeine. The carbon dioxide is then used on another batch of beans. This liquid works better than water because it is kept in supercritical state near the transition from liquid to gas&#44; combining favorable diffusivity properties of the gas with increased density of a liquid. This process has the advantage that it avoids the use of potentially harmful substances.<br />The extracted caffeine is purified and sold to pharmaceutical firms&#44; soft drink companies and other businesses that add caffeine to their products.<br />The USFDA (United States Food and Drug Administration) allows a residual Methylene chloride content of 10 parts per million. However&#44; after roasting not even these trace levels are detectable in the bean. The Methylene chloride dissipates at a much lower temperature (approx 120° Fahrenheit) than the coffee is roasted at (approx.428° Fahrenheit).<br />Other decaffeinating methods include methylene chloride&#44; ethyl acetate and water process. Illycaffè does not use the water process because water processed coffees generally produce a less flavorful and flatter bodied cup of coffee. This process uses warm water under pressure to extract caffeine. The water is heated&#44; 70-100° Celsius (120 to 160° Fahrenheit) and circulated until 94% to 96% of the caffeine is removed. In some cases the water is put through carbon filtration to remove the caffeine. Since caffeine is not the only substance in coffee that is soluble&#44; important flavor components are also affected.<br />Coffee and caffeine have been the subject of extensive scientific research in the last 25 years. Some 1500 to 2000 papers per year have been published and we can assume that there are few products that we consume that have been so thoroughly and deeply studied. New research has shown that caffeine has many positive effects on the body—from improving concentration to fighting depression and reducing the risk of gallstones. But for the country's 107 million coffee drinkers&#44; coffee is a pleasure&#44; not a medicine&#44; and for those who want a break from caffeine&#44; illy provides the best tasting decaf available.

Parchment coffee is stored in well ventilated warehouses before sold.<br />PNG is an extremely diverse country with over 800 different languages spoken. Most of the tribes from the highlands did not have contact with white men until the 1930s as exploration in PNG had been minimal. PNG is now a paradox between Western influence and indigenous traditions.<br />Commercial coffee production started in Papua New Guinea in the 1920s with seeds brought from Jamaica’s Blue Mountain&#44; a Typica known as Jamacica Blue Mountain. At that time most of the coffee production came from 18 large plantations. Plantations still exist in PNG but it only accounts for 15% of the total production; most of the production now comes from small-holders who tend to their coffee gardens&#44; as they call them locally. The small-holders are subsistence farmers (meaning they live of their land) and they also grow coffee--there are no coffee farmers per-se. Each garden might have anywhere from a couple to a couple hundred trees of coffee and parchment deliveries can range from 25 - 65 kg.<br />Kunjin comes from smallholders between 1400–800 meters&#44; from the Waghi Valley in Western Highlands&#44; in close proximity to the town of Mount Hagen. Coffee is being processed in a leased vintage John Gordon–brand wet mill in an old plantation. Owning a mill or property in PNG is risky&#44; and it could take years to establish a reputation of trust with the local tribes. Even if you make a deal&#44; there is always risk of losing it&#44; as the tribe could simply change their mind on the deal once they see the mill is profitable.<br />Personally&#44; I'm really excited to work with PNG as a coffee-producing country &#44; being culturally and socially as foreign as it gets. During my first visit in 2012&#44; my luggage was left in Jakarta and I wouldn't get it back until my way out of PNG. I took a cab to Vision City Mega Mall&#44; in the capital city of Port Moresby&#44; and bought a Quicksilver T -shirt for $50 USD—and there weren't many options. The Highlander Hotel in Mount Hagen will run you $300 USD per night with cockroaches in your room&#44; and you might get the suite over the kitchen—good luck sleeping! On the other hand&#44; locals are living off their land with very little income. One of the reasons of such disparity is that there is a big mining boom as we speak&#44; where multinationals are extracting valuable minerals and have brought local prices up as mining is very resource-intensive.<br />PNG is another one of those countries which has great potential&#44; but it's still far away from hitting its peak. It has heirloom varieties and great altitude&#44; but its social and economic problems makes it extremely hard to achieve top-quality coffee. We are happy&#44; nonetheless&#44; with the quality we are seeing this year&#44; and cleanliness in the cup is one of the biggest attributes for these. As always&#44; we will push the bar for better quality!  — Piero Cristiani<br /><br />,wh2-boston,1000,

The process that transforms ordinary Arabica coffee beans into a roast that is hailed as one of the most unique—and most expensive—in the world&#44; only happens in Southeast Asia. Gayo Kopi embraces an elaborate 10-step process to produce the finest Kopi Luwak coffee in the world. Order a package of this rare coffee and discover why Hollywood superstar Jack Nicholson included it on his “Bucket List” in the 2007 blockbuster film. 100 grams of whole bean Kopi Luwak coffee.,99,99,$50.00-$99.99,1st in Coffee,,,,https://caas-demo-products.s3.amazonaws.com/b2c-accelerator/Coffeefy/1stincoffee_images/kopi-luwak-3oz.jpg|https://caas-demo-products.s3.amazonaws.com/b2c-accelerator/Coffeefy/1stincoffee_images/kopi-luwak-coffee-beans-roasted.png|https://caas-demo-products.s3.amazonaws.com/b2c-accelerator/Coffeefy/1stincoffee_images/gk-box-holding.jpg| ,<br /><br />The Beans are Just the Beginning<br />Arabica beans are prized for their rich aroma&#44; chocolate notes and caramel finish so it’s no surprise that Gayo features these popular beans in their Kopi Luwak coffee—but the beans are just part of what sets this coffee apart.<br />In Indonesia&#44; Kopi Luwak refers to coffee (kopi) and a native animal called the palm civet (luwak). The adorable cat-like creatures love fresh fruit and coffee beans&#44; sniffing out the finest beans in Indonesia and turning them into a meal. After the civets eat and digest the coffee beans&#44; foragers collect them: The beans are washed&#44; dried&#44; sorted and roasted in a process that transforms them from regular coffee beans to one of the most sought-after brews in the world. It’s a labor-intensive process that results in an amazing cup of coffee.<br />The Most Expensive Coffee in the World<br />One cup of Kopi Luwak coffee&#44; sometimes called civet coffee&#44; can cost upwards of $30; 100 grams retails for $100. Is it worth it? YES! <br />Some Kopi Luwak coffee producers raise civets on farms&#44; feeding them an exclusive diet of coffee beans. Removing these beautiful creatures from the wild and limiting their diets to coffee beans takes their toll on the health and wellbeing of the civets. Gayo Kopi commends the animal rights activists who have raised awareness of this cruel process.<br />All of the beans used in Gayo Kopi were sourced from wild animals. None of their coffee is ever sourced from caged or farmed luwak. Since production is low&#44; the costs are higher but you can enjoy each sip knowing no animals were harmed to make this world class coffee.<br />To further protect the wild creatures&#44; Gayo Kopi donates a percentage of the proceeds from the sale of each bag of its coffee to World Animal Protection&#44; a nonprofit organization that campaigns against the production of cage-sourced Kopi Luwak. A stringent traceability process guarantees that each bean is certified as wild-sourced and includes information about the times and locations the beans were gathered; it’s an effort that makes the world’s rarest coffee even more rare.<br />A Flavor Experience<br />One sip of Kopi Luwak coffee makes it clear that the one-of-a-kind process has a major impact on the flavor. As the beans are digested&#44; the bitterness almost disappears and new flavor notes are introduced. The rare specialty coffee has incredible depth of flavor with notes of dark chocolate&#44; toffee&#44; caramel and molasses; hints of star anise are also prominent. The civets thrive on a diet of fresh&#44; exotic fruits that can also be detected in the coffee. Kopi Luwak has a creamy flavor and silky finish. <br />Gayo Kopi partners with famers and processors who have intricate knowledge of coffee&#44; a passion for the elaborate process and a devotion to producing the best Kopi Luwak in the world. You’ll taste their commitment to quality in each sip of Gayo Kopi.<br />,wh2-boston,1000,

As a result&#44; illy coffee's exquisite and consistent taste and exceptional freshness provide an exceptional coffee experience you can't find from anyone else! One cup and you'll understand why illy is the number one choice of top chefs&#44; coffee experts and espresso connoisseurs.<br />Founded in 1933 in Trieste&#44; Italy&#44; illycaffè is the quality and innovation leader in the coffee industry. According to Coffee and Cocoa International&#44; an industry trade magazine&#44; ""illycaffè's entire ethos is built on quality.""  illycaffè produces a unique single blend of gourmet coffee for both brewed and espresso preparation made from 100% high quality Arabica beans&#44; which it tailor-packages for sale to restaurants&#44; cafes&#44; homes and offices. In Italy&#44; it is the leading brand in the hotel&#44; restaurant&#44; and bar segment. Each day&#44; over two million illy espressos are served in Italy alone. And each day more than five million people in the world who know quality&#44; choose illy for their coffee.  Quality&#44; research&#44; innovation In line with the company mission to ""delight consumers all over the world with an excellent cup of coffee and do everything possible to improve its quality""&#44; research on coffee has had a strategic role for many years at illycaffè. The company's objective is to fully utilize the knowledge gained through its research to continuously improve the quality of its products.   Espresso&#44; while apparently a simple drink&#44; is in reality a complex product. It is derived from 1500 chemical substances (800 volatile and 700 soluble) and when prepared correctly involves 13 independent chemical and physical variables. Research on espresso is extremely complex and highly specialized&#44; requiring a multidisciplinary approach involving the fields of agronomy&#44; botany&#44; physics&#44; mathematics&#44; chemistry&#44; biochemistry&#44; biology&#44; statistics and computer science&#44; among others.  By applying the scientific method to quality improvement&#44; illycaffè has built a model program for innovative research and development&#44; closely collaborating with the academic world through important university institutes&#44; research centers and expert researchers hired for specific projects.  From bean to cup  The illy caffè blend is obtained by carefully selecting from different sources the best Arabica beans&#44; which have a richer taste and lower caffeine content than the less-prized (and less expensive) Robusta beans. illy caffè &#44; in a joint venture with Sortex Ltd.&#44; designed its own state-of-the-art electronic machinery that examines each individual coffee bean&#44; eliminating the inferior ones. About 50 coffee beans are needed to produce a one-ounce cup of espresso&#44; and only one bad bean can ruin its flavor.  illycaffè perfectly roasts its coffee for full flavor without burning or over roasting the beans. The roasted coffee is then air-cooled. Another illy caffè exclusive is the pressurization technique used by the company to preserve its coffee. In this process&#44; air is extracted from the cans and replaced with inert gasses at a higher-than-atmospheric level of pressure. This method guarantees a longer preservation time&#44; maintaining the coffee's freshness for over 24 months until it is prepared. At the same time it ""ages"" the coffee&#44; improving its aroma over time by causing its volatile aroma compounds to bind with the oils that are contained in the beans. Simple vacuum packing cannot achieve this flavor transformation. The effect of this aging process is similar in many ways to the development of complex flavors when a fine red wine is aged under the proper conditions. <br />",wh2-boston,1000,

Caffeine&#44; which acts on the prefrontal cortex&#44; increases alertness and improves short-term memory. Each person has their own threshold for caffeine—the point where it ceases to be pleasant and gives us the jitters. People who enjoy coffee in the morning may eschew it in the evening. And there are others who enjoy a cup of coffee&#44; hold the caffeine please.<br />""In creating our decaffeinated illy coffee&#44; we wanted to keep the complex aromas that illy is known for&#44;"" says Dr. Ernesto Illy. ""After careful research&#44; we selected our decaffeinating process based on its superior conservation of aromas and full&#44; pleasant taste in the decaf. In blind tastings&#44; many professional tasters picked illy decaf as their first choice for aroma and taste—even beating our regular (caffeinated) coffee. That is because inherently caffeine has a slight bitterness to it&#44; so when you decaffeinate coffee properly&#44; it tastes slightly sweeter. If you can also capture the same complex aromas—you have a truly wonderful cup of coffee—if you don't miss the caffeine.""<br />A Short History of Decaffeination<br />Dr. Ludwig Roselius and Dr. Karl Wimmer invented the process of removing caffeine from coffee in Bremen&#44; Germany as described in a patent letter dated from 1905. By 1912 the first decaffeinating plant was opened in the United States.<br />In order for a coffee to be designated as ""decaffeinated"" the caffeine content must be lower than 0.10% according to the European Standard<br />There are several methods of making decaffeinated espresso and coffee: Methylene Chloride&#44; Ethyl Acetate&#44; and Water Process<br />illycaffè's method of choice - Carbon Dioxide<br />This process is technically known as supercritical fluid extraction. In the carbon dioxide method&#44; the caffeine is stripped directly from the beans by a highly compressed semi-liquid form of carbon dioxide. Pre-steamed beans are soaked in a bath of supercritical carbon dioxide at a pressure of 73 to 300 atmospheres. After a thorough soaking for around ten hours&#44; the pressure is reduced&#44; allowing the CO2 to evaporate&#44; or the pressurized CO2 is run through either water or charcoal filters to remove the caffeine. The carbon dioxide is then used on another batch of beans. This liquid works better than water because it is kept in supercritical state near the transition from liquid to gas&#44; combining favorable diffusivity properties of the gas with increased density of a liquid. This process has the advantage that it avoids the use of potentially harmful substances.<br />The extracted caffeine is purified and sold to pharmaceutical firms&#44; soft drink companies and other businesses that add caffeine to their products.<br />The USFDA (United States Food and Drug Administration) allows a residual Methylene chloride content of 10 parts per million. However&#44; after roasting not even these trace levels are detectable in the bean. The Methylene chloride dissipates at a much lower temperature (approx 120° Fahrenheit) than the coffee is roasted at (approx.428° Fahrenheit).<br />Other decaffeinating methods include methylene chloride&#44; ethyl acetate and water process. Illycaffè does not use the water process because water processed coffees generally produce a less flavorful and flatter bodied cup of coffee. This process uses warm water under pressure to extract caffeine. The water is heated&#44; 70-100° Celsius (120 to 160° Fahrenheit) and circulated until 94% to 96% of the caffeine is removed. In some cases the water is put through carbon filtration to remove the caffeine. Since caffeine is not the only substance in coffee that is soluble&#44; important flavor components are also affected.<br />Coffee and caffeine have been the subject of extensive scientific research in the last 25 years. Some 1500 to 2000 papers per year have been published and we can assume that there are few products that we consume that have been so thoroughly and deeply studied. New research has shown that caffeine has many positive effects on the body—from improving concentration to fighting depression and reducing the risk of gallstones. But for the country's 107 million coffee drinkers&#44; coffee is a pleasure&#44; not a medicine&#44; and for those who want a break from caffeine&#44; illy provides the best tasting decaf available.

Italy's leading coffee company&#44; has been roasting coffees for over 100 years at its plant in the northwest Italian city of Turin.  Lavazza's state-of-the-art roasting facility boasts the world's highest concentration of advanced coffee technology.  The entire process&#44; from sacks of green beans to pallets of packaged roasted coffees&#44; is computerized and centrally monitored.  Special attention is paid to each bean as it is inspected for any imperfections and then roasted in air convection roasters which guarantee that each bean is evenly browned and never scorched.  Lavazza's investments in technology&#44; research and development and its dedication to quality control combined with the long roasting tradition of this family-owned company have made the Lavazza brand recognizable worldwide as the leader in espresso coffee.<br />Over one hundred years ago&#44; Luigi Lavazza created the concept of blends&#44; an aspect that has discovered its maximum expression in the culture of coffee. A fundamental part of making a quality beverage&#44; the finest blends come from a mixture of different coffee varieties - up to even five or six. For example&#44; blends made exclusively with Arabica are sweeter and more fragrant&#44; while blends of Arabica and Robusta have a more full-bodied and decisive flavor. With over one hundred years of experience&#44; today Lavazza modulates the sensory characteristics in the cup with 100% Arabica blends as well as blends with both Arabica and Robusta. Lavazza espresso coffee uses various coffees from Brazil and Central American&#44; this allows us to create a wide range of blends with different notes of flavor and aroma: a full&#44; chocolaty flavor when the Brazilian qualities prevail&#44; or fragrant&#44; delicate&#44; mildly acidic and aromatic coffee when we use washed Arabica from Central America<br />,wh2-boston,1000,

Parchment coffee is stored in well ventilated warehouses before sold.<br />PNG is an extremely diverse country with over 800 different languages spoken. Most of the tribes from the highlands did not have contact with white men until the 1930s as exploration in PNG had been minimal. PNG is now a paradox between Western influence and indigenous traditions.<br />Commercial coffee production started in Papua New Guinea in the 1920s with seeds brought from Jamaica’s Blue Mountain&#44; a Typica known as Jamacica Blue Mountain. At that time most of the coffee production came from 18 large plantations. Plantations still exist in PNG but it only accounts for 15% of the total production; most of the production now comes from small-holders who tend to their coffee gardens&#44; as they call them locally. The small-holders are subsistence farmers (meaning they live of their land) and they also grow coffee--there are no coffee farmers per-se. Each garden might have anywhere from a couple to a couple hundred trees of coffee and parchment deliveries can range from 25 - 65 kg.<br />Kunjin comes from smallholders between 1400–800 meters&#44; from the Waghi Valley in Western Highlands&#44; in close proximity to the town of Mount Hagen. Coffee is being processed in a leased vintage John Gordon–brand wet mill in an old plantation. Owning a mill or property in PNG is risky&#44; and it could take years to establish a reputation of trust with the local tribes. Even if you make a deal&#44; there is always risk of losing it&#44; as the tribe could simply change their mind on the deal once they see the mill is profitable.<br />Personally&#44; I'm really excited to work with PNG as a coffee-producing country &#44; being culturally and socially as foreign as it gets. During my first visit in 2012&#44; my luggage was left in Jakarta and I wouldn't get it back until my way out of PNG. I took a cab to Vision City Mega Mall&#44; in the capital city of Port Moresby&#44; and bought a Quicksilver T -shirt for $50 USD—and there weren't many options. The Highlander Hotel in Mount Hagen will run you $300 USD per night with cockroaches in your room&#44; and you might get the suite over the kitchen—good luck sleeping! On the other hand&#44; locals are living off their land with very little income. One of the reasons of such disparity is that there is a big mining boom as we speak&#44; where multinationals are extracting valuable minerals and have brought local prices up as mining is very resource-intensive.<br />PNG is another one of those countries which has great potential&#44; but it's still far away from hitting its peak. It has heirloom varieties and great altitude&#44; but its social and economic problems makes it extremely hard to achieve top-quality coffee. We are happy&#44; nonetheless&#44; with the quality we are seeing this year&#44; and cleanliness in the cup is one of the biggest attributes for these. As always&#44; we will push the bar for better quality!  — Piero Cristiani<br /><br />,wh2-boston,1000,497102

The process that transforms ordinary Arabica coffee beans into a roast that is hailed as one of the most unique—and most expensive—in the world&#44; only happens in Southeast Asia. Gayo Kopi embraces an elaborate 10-step process to produce the finest Kopi Luwak coffee in the world. Order a package of this rare coffee and discover why Hollywood superstar Jack Nicholson included it on his “Bucket List” in the 2007 blockbuster film. 100 grams of whole bean Kopi Luwak coffee.,99,99,$50.00-$99.99,1st in Coffee,,,,https://caas-demo-products.s3.amazonaws.com/b2c-accelerator/Coffeefy/1stincoffee_images/kopi-luwak-3oz.jpg|https://caas-demo-products.s3.amazonaws.com/b2c-accelerator/Coffeefy/1stincoffee_images/kopi-luwak-coffee-beans-roasted.png|https://caas-demo-products.s3.amazonaws.com/b2c-accelerator/Coffeefy/1stincoffee_images/gk-box-holding.jpg| ,<br /><br />The Beans are Just the Beginning<br />Arabica beans are prized for their rich aroma&#44; chocolate notes and caramel finish so it’s no surprise that Gayo features these popular beans in their Kopi Luwak coffee—but the beans are just part of what sets this coffee apart.<br />In Indonesia&#44; Kopi Luwak refers to coffee (kopi) and a native animal called the palm civet (luwak). The adorable cat-like creatures love fresh fruit and coffee beans&#44; sniffing out the finest beans in Indonesia and turning them into a meal. After the civets eat and digest the coffee beans&#44; foragers collect them: The beans are washed&#44; dried&#44; sorted and roasted in a process that transforms them from regular coffee beans to one of the most sought-after brews in the world. It’s a labor-intensive process that results in an amazing cup of coffee.<br />The Most Expensive Coffee in the World<br />One cup of Kopi Luwak coffee&#44; sometimes called civet coffee&#44; can cost upwards of $30; 100 grams retails for $100. Is it worth it? YES! <br />Some Kopi Luwak coffee producers raise civets on farms&#44; feeding them an exclusive diet of coffee beans. Removing these beautiful creatures from the wild and limiting their diets to coffee beans takes their toll on the health and wellbeing of the civets. Gayo Kopi commends the animal rights activists who have raised awareness of this cruel process.<br />All of the beans used in Gayo Kopi were sourced from wild animals. None of their coffee is ever sourced from caged or farmed luwak. Since production is low&#44; the costs are higher but you can enjoy each sip knowing no animals were harmed to make this world class coffee.<br />To further protect the wild creatures&#44; Gayo Kopi donates a percentage of the proceeds from the sale of each bag of its coffee to World Animal Protection&#44; a nonprofit organization that campaigns against the production of cage-sourced Kopi Luwak. A stringent traceability process guarantees that each bean is certified as wild-sourced and includes information about the times and locations the beans were gathered; it’s an effort that makes the world’s rarest coffee even more rare.<br />A Flavor Experience<br />One sip of Kopi Luwak coffee makes it clear that the one-of-a-kind process has a major impact on the flavor. As the beans are digested&#44; the bitterness almost disappears and new flavor notes are introduced. The rare specialty coffee has incredible depth of flavor with notes of dark chocolate&#44; toffee&#44; caramel and molasses; hints of star anise are also prominent. The civets thrive on a diet of fresh&#44; exotic fruits that can also be detected in the coffee. Kopi Luwak has a creamy flavor and silky finish. <br />Gayo Kopi partners with famers and processors who have intricate knowledge of coffee&#44; a passion for the elaborate process and a devotion to producing the best Kopi Luwak in the world. You’ll taste their commitment to quality in each sip of Gayo Kopi.<br />,wh2-boston,1000,48013

It is a land of seductive scenery full of rivers and waterfalls. The provincial city of Popayàn&#44; founded in the 16th century and known as the “ciudad blanca”&#44; is an important tourist destination and religious centre. It is also famous for the Holy Week celebrations held there. In a land as diverse as Cauca&#44; the coffee-growing zone in the north of Río Patía is unusually homogenous and provides the perfect conditions for a good harvest.Wedged between the high cordillera and the high plains at an altitude of 1700 m&#44; in this mountainous territory the climate is stable&#44; the rain abundant&#44; the volcanic soil highly fertile&#44; and there is a clear distinction between the dry and rainy seasons. All these factors contribute to excellent coffee. Arabica from Cauca is harvested by hand and appreciated all over the world for its particular sweetness.<br />illy Monoarabica Colombia meets all the standards of the Federación Nacional de Cafeteros&#44; and has obtained the PGI (Protected Geographic Indication) logo&#44; an accreditation recognised worldwide as a guarantee of a product’s origin and quality.When Francisnet arrives at the farm&#44; Carlos welcomes his friend and colleague warmly: this is the time for the customary tinto&#44; a cup of piping hot black coffee which they often enjoy together. As Carlos collaborates with the National Coffee Growers’ Federation&#44; his days are filled with meetings such as this&#44; and a whole host of other commitments. Apart from running his own plantation&#44; he dedicates much of his time to the other growers&#44; keeping an eye on their harvests and helping them to resolve various problems. Over the years&#44; through his work he has met many coffee growers and has come to know and appreciate the role of coffee in the social fabric of Cauca. In this multi-ethnic region&#44; which is home to the descendants of indigenous pre-Hispanic tribes such as the Los Paeces and the Misak&#44; about 97&#44;000 families grow Arabica. It is an authentic local tradition.<br />Like many of them&#44; Carlos is also a “son of coffee”. By following in the footsteps of his father and working in the fields he managed to complete his studies&#44; become an agronomist and improve his social and financial fortunes.According to an old saying from these parts&#44; coffee always brings with it good things. In the past&#44; Cauca people have even used it to heal wounds and cuts. Watching his friend Francisnet as he leaves to go back to his fields&#44; Carlos thinks of all the good things that coffee has in store for his children in the future. Today will be another good day.<br />,wh2-boston,1000,48014

Just like any other press pot&#44; add the ground coffee&#44; pour in hot water&#44; insert the filter and allow to steep.

Two different stainless steel mesh screens&#44; each of them from 9 to 12 times finer than the screens found in other press pots&#44; filter out nearly 100% of the sediment that adds bitterness and sludge to the coffee made in other press pots. The filter system is so efficient in separating the liquid from the grounds that the coffee can be left in the vessel with virtually no worry about over-extraction.<br />Put an End to Sludge - Ever mistakenly sip the last of a cup from an old design press pot? Nasty and bitter! That bitter sip can ruin the coffee experience. It's not going to happen with the Espro Press. You get a clean cup and smooth taste every time&#44; right to the bottom of the cup&#44; right to the bottom of the pot.<br />Espro Press Features<br />The two-part filter separates easily for cleaning without the use of tools. The attention to details is reflected here as well- the junction of the two halves is sealed with an O-ring. Every drop of coffee has to pass through both filter screen before it gets to your cup.<br />The filter system has a silicone seal around its outer-perimeter which securely presses against the inner chamber's wall. This ensures that the grounds stay where they belong&#44; in the bottom of the pot. This seal is just one more part which further increases the efficiency of the filter system.<br />The plastic used in the filters is BPA free&#44; BPS free&#44; and phthalate free. The raw plastic material is made in the USA and the filters are manufactured in Canada.<br />Instead of glass&#44; the vessel is stainless steel inside and out. The double wall vessel stays cool on the outside because instead of just adding some sort of insulation between the layers&#44; the Espro Press has the chamber between the walls evacuated forming an all-metal&#44; vacuum-insulated vessel. Cool on the outside while keeping the heat where it belongs- in the coffee!<br />Virtually unbreakable - No more having to replace fragile glass vessels! With basic care this could very well be the last press pot you ever have to buy! Even the handle is permanently attached to the chamber!<br />The large handle makes the Espro Press easy to hold. It's diameter is easy to grip and runs nearly the entire length of the vessel. It also adds to the elegant and stylish look of the Espro Press.<br />Tea&#44; anyone? The Espresso coffee press can also be used the brew tea!<br />The Espro Press is available in two sizes:<br /><br />MEDIUM 18 ounce - makes approximately two 2 cups - Polished finish<br /><br />LARGE   32 ounce - makes about 4 cups - Brushed finish <br /><br />Why take another sip of bitter coffee and sludge?

Never drawing more than 15 amps this Domobar's advanced power management system automatically maintains the proper power to both boilers&#44; ensuring perfect temperature.,2695,2695,$2500.00-$4999.99,Vibiemme,,,,https://caas-demo-products.s3.amazonaws.com/b2c-accelerator/Coffeefy/1stincoffee_images/vibiemme-double-domobar.jpg| ,"<br /><br />Now in its fourth generation&#44; the VBM Domobar Double is proving itself the leader in home double-boiler espresso machines!<br />• Double boilers - the user can operate the coffee boiler and steam boiler independently of each other (or at the same time). Dual boilers allow steam and hot water to be help separately from the water being used for brewing espresso. Like 202F. Instead of 201F for espresso? No Problem! The adjustment can be easily made right from the front panel at the push of a button! • Boiler Insulation - Both boilers are now insulated to save energy and further increase temperature stability.• Four position power switch (Off&#44; Brew only&#44; Both&#44; Steam only) offers flexibility and power savings. Just make espresso? No problem! Just turn off the steam boiler by selecting the Espresso-Only position.• PID (Proportional&#44; Integral&#44; Derivative) temperature control – More than just a thermostat! With a computer controlling the temperature adjustment of the two boilers you get precise control. This is critical for quality espresso. New in Version 4&#44; the PID also manages the steam/hot water boiler. {** unsure about this next part**} A safety pressurestat makes sure that the steam boiler stays within safe parameters. • Power management control systems (PCMS) - Two boiler&#44; multiple heating elements and a powerful pump makes the VBM DD a powerful machine. But the PCMS regulates the amount of power to each heating element ensuring no more than 15 amps are drawn by the machine at any time. That means the Vibiemme DD will operate from a standard household 15amp outlet. • Heavy duty true Faema E61 grouphead – The Vibiemme company was founded by the creators of the famed E-61 group&#44; and over the years they have created the gold standard for the rest of the manufacturers to follow. Their massive brass group is designed for dependable service and ease of maintenance. The thermal siphon keeps the group hot for improved temperature stability. • Commercial-grade motor and rotary vane pump - Smooth delivery of water to the coffee&#44; quieter than a vibratory pump&#44; and you have the choice of using the internal reservoir or connecting the Vibiemme DD directly to an existing water line. Imagine never having to fill a reservoir or running out of water in the middle of an extraction again! Included is a stainless steel braided hose with 3/8"" male thread if you choose the direct-connection option. A lever on the bottom of the machines allows switching back and forth between the options. This makes descaling an easy matter if you choose to direct connect.• Extremely large stainless steel drip tray which can be easily removed for cleaning. The new covering grate is designed for less splashing. Grate stays on machine when pulling out drip tray. The drip tray can be used as a standard&#44; pull-out-and-empty design&#44; but also includes the fittings and hose to plumb the tray to a drain (consult a plumber for local codes). Along with a plumbed in water supply&#44; this option can make for hassle-free brewing!<br />Other Features Include:• Mirror-polished stainless steel body panel• Professional grade brass portafilters - one portafilter with single spout and single filter basket and one portafilter with dual spout and double filter basket • Steam boiler pressure gauge (reading will vary between 1.5 and 1.6 bar pressure)• Pump pressure gauge to indicate brew pressure during espresso extraction• Multi-directional stainless steel steam wand on left side • Multi-directional stainless steel hot water wand on right side • Power indicator light on right side indicates when the machine is powered on • Heating light on left side indicates when espresso machine is heating • Low water level light in middle indicates when water level in water reservoir in rear is low (when reservoir option is chosen by the user) • GICAR branded electronic water level control for steam boiler.<br />Specifications: • 0.5 liter copper boiler coffee boiler capacity • 1.9 liter copper boiler steam boiler capacity • 2.1 liter water reservoir&#44; fresh water can be added at any time. • Accessories: Single spout portafilter&#44; single dose filter basket&#44; double spout portafilter&#44; double dose filter basket&#44; blind filter basket for backflushing&#44; plastic coffee scoop&#44; and a plastic tamper • 2 year warranty against manufacturing defects • Dimensions: 10.6"" W x 21.0"" D x 16.5"" H • Electrical: 110 volts only&#44; 1600 watts (regulated between both boilers)&#44; 15 amp (maximum needed). • Shipping weight: 84 pounds<br />",wh2-boston,1000,

It brews one or two servings at a time by simply filling the basket with ground coffee&#44; inserting it into the machine&#44; and starting the brew cycle. The system in the portafilter body creates the resistance to the water flow automatically.<br />The included bottomless espresso filter uses coffee you grind. The adjustment you make to your grinder controls the flow of the espresso. Grind finer to slow the flow and more coarsely to speed up the flow (grinder not included). Because this handle has no bottom&#44; you can instantly see the espresso as it is created and make adjustments to your procedure accordingly. A bottomless portafilter is optional at additional cost with most machines if it is available at all! The ability to grind your own coffee and adjust the grind aids in producing richer&#44; thicker crema.<br />Advanced Boiler and Pump System<br />The advanced design boiler of the Café PRO maintains a reserve of hot water to aid in delivering the perfect temperature for each espresso.

The adjustment you make to your grinder controls the flow of the espresso. Grind finer to slow the flow and more coarsely to speed up the flow in this Capresso espresso maker (grinder not included). Because this handle has no bottom&#44; you can instantly see the espresso as it is created and make adjustments to your procedure accordingly. A bottomless portafilter is optional at additional cost with most machines if it is available at all!
